  - title: Re-architecture of the ML big-data data pipelines
    date: Dec 2022 - Jun 2023
    description: One of the main contributors out of the two, to re-design and implement a new version of the data pipeline that simplifies the architecture and allows faster evolutions. This pipeline is handling petabytes of data daily. We leveraged Iceberg and other technologies and refactored the existing Spark jobs to a cleaner and simpler design. We reduced the number of job applications from 15 to 1 for a module.
    problem: My team utilizes AI/ML to overcome advertising attribution challenges while maintaining compliance with strict privacy regulations that prohibit user identity capture and storage. The existing data ingestion pipeline consisted of more than 20 jobs that were hard to maintain and expand. I was assigned to integrate our AI/ML pipeline with a new Amazon advertising product.
    action: Expansion to the new product required changes in the pipeline jobs. I used this opportunity to derive the team's focus on re-architecting the pipelines using a data-lake technology and simplifying it. I started building the new product expansion using the new architecture while considering migrating the existing pipeline to it.
    result: I became one of the main contributors (out of two) to the pipeline re-architecting. In one case we managed to reduce the number of jobs from 15 to 1 which was making debugging and changing the code significantly easier.

  - title: Re-architecting the SSO and migrate to cloud
    date: Nov 2020 - Jun 2021
    description: Led the redesign and implementation of the next generation of Acceptto's SSO microservice to make it horizontally scalable and highly available. The old SSO module was a web server that should be run and maintained on the customer site. The new version was designed to run in the cloud and connect to the customer's user directory using an agent. This project reduced the customer onboarding time from days to hours.

  - title: Policy Orchestration Engine for an IAM Solution
    date: Apr 2019 - Sep 2019
    description: Designed and implemented a policy orchestration engine that allows customers to define their rules and condition to customize a core IAM solution software behavior. For example, customers can dynamically define policies to ask for MFA in addition to passwords when the user is logging in from a specific location or specific time of day, or a specific risk profile associated with the user. In addition to a UI, it allows power users to write their own predicates and policies. This feature provided a competitive advantage for the company in the industry which led to at least two successful accounts.

  - title: Book Coupon Distribution System
    pdf_resume: true
    date: Jun 2016 - Dec 2016
    description: Built an online registration, allocation, and payment system that handled the sales of book coupons for students used in international Iranian book fairs. This app handled the equivalent of $2M transactions within two weeks of the Tehran International Book Fair. Probably the largest project built entirely using the Scala ecosystem in Iran for the first time.
    problem: My client was responsible for the distribution of book coupons to students so that they can use them at book fairs to buy books. Students had to go to banks or other institutions to register and receive the coupons. For the biggest events like Tehran International Book Fair, there was always more demand than available coupons which was leading to some logistic issues both for providers and users.
    action: As a solo developer, I built an online registration, allocation, and payment system that handled the registration and sales of coupons. It allowed the admins to allocate a certain number of coupons based on different factors such as city, education, etc. It was implemented using Scala, Play Framework, MongoDB, and Akka.
    result: This app handled the equivalent of $2M transactions within two weeks of the Tehran International Book Fair successfully and was received very well by the users and organizers of the book fair. It was probably the largest project built entirely using the Scala ecosystem in Iran for the first time.

    description: Built the entire backend for a health and fitness application that connects the specialist to clients to coach them for exercise and diet. Released the first version to production within 2 months and then shaped and led the backend team.
    problem: My client was a new startup in the health and wellbeing section building an app that was connecting exercise and diet specialists to users. They already had some progress in building the mobile app but they were struggling to find resources for their backend side. My client was looking for a full-time employee but I assured them that I can fill the gap as a fractional engineer and even help them build the backend team.
    action: I requested my client to give me one day a week and asses the result in 4 weeks, if there were not happy with the result they don't need to pay anything. I designed and built the backend features within the first few weeks to the point that the backend features were ahead of the front end.
    result: My client was satisfied with the result. Within the next few months, I also built a backend team that continued building and launched the next versions of the product within the next 2 years.

    date: Feb 2014 - Feb 2016
    description: |
      Developed several custom-made content management systems on top of a homemade framework using Scala and Playframework offering superior performance by utilizing non-blocking io. In addition to the technical advantages they were designed to be simple so non-technical people can easily create and maintain the content and elements of the websites.

      Some of these websites:

      - http://icfi.ir/
      - http://hrsolutions.ir/
      - http://celltech.co/
      - http://aradwcg.com/
      - http://gmpsmartsolution.com/
      - http://irancable.com/'
    problem: I had multiple customers who needed a content management system for their business but the available options in the market were too technical for their staff.
    action: I built a CMS that not only was performing very well on light hardware but also was designed to be easy to work with by less-technical people. Its admin panel was customizable to their need. The customization of the admin panel was done by me and the result was an admin panel that my client staff could quickly learn to use.
    result: This CMS made all my clients self-sufficient to continue maintaining their website content saving them thousands of dollars a year.

    problem: My client had to use human resources in order to submit data and monitor the state of the request in some external systems. This was an error-prone, time-consuming, and costly process. The external system was not providing any APIs for integration either.
    action: I implemented a bot using Selenium and Django that acts as an agent that submits the information, periodically checks them on the external website, and keeps the data in sync with its local database. It was offering some REST API that my client used to integrate with their systems.
    result: My client operation cost related to this external website was reduced by up to 5 times while the human errors were completely eliminated.

Serving tens of thousands of users per day using a single CPU and 2.5GB of RAM thanks to using non-blocking IO and async programming.
    problem: My client was responsible for holding book fairs and managing publishers' registration all over the country including the biggest cultural event in the country, Tehran International Book Fair. The publisher's registration process was done physically which was time-consuming and costly for both publishers and my client.
    action: I analyzed the registration processes and designed and implemented a custom-made fair registration system that automates book publishers' registration process fully online. It was also allowing the publishers to import their books to be published on the other website which was dedicated to visitors. Visitors could search for books and publisher locations online and plan for their visit before going to the fair.
    result: It handled more than 40 provincial book fairs in the country, including the Tehran International Book Fair, with Alexa's rank below 500 among Iranian websites during the fair times. Thanks to using non-blocking IO and async programming it served tens of thousands of users per day using a single CPU and 2.5GB of RAM.
