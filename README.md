# My DIY Static Website Builder

This is a simple static website builder written in Python. I built https://4m1r.dev using it.

## Setup

```
npm install
poetry install
```

## Run

To run in development mode run the following after installing the dependencies in `requirements.txt`:

```
python main.py serve --watch
```

## Build

To generate the final website run:

```
python main.py build
```
