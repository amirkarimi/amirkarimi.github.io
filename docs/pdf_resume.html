                    <strong>Boot loader (Personal Project)</strong> (2001) - A boot loader program written from scratch to run from a floppy disk, built using my home-grown text rendering library. It was an effort to develop a basic operating system. I learned about working with low-level IO, direct screen memory access handling, memory management, and re-implemented some functions of the C standard library since the original ones depended on MS-DOS.
