        <div class="font-normal">
            <p>The event-driven design has already been around for a while. Like many other trendy patterns, it's far older than what we think. Before the web era, it was quite normal to design stand-alone desktop applications using this design. But it is even older than that. It has already been used massively since the mainframe era (and probably even before).</p>
<p>This is the story of how I learned about event-driven design without even knowing what it's called in the late 90s when I was just getting started to learn how computers work.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>You might have noticed how many pins are connecting your keyboard to a computer? Though it's hard to see the pins on a USB port it was more visible on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port">PS/2 connectors</a>. Either way, it's definitely not enough to deliver the state of all the keys simultaneously. For a keyboard with 110 keys in 6 rows, we need about 25 pins (6 rows x 19 columns) to be able to transfer the whole keyboard status simultaneously.</p>
<p><img alt="Source: Wikipedia" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/FunctionalCircuitDiagramOfKeyboardNumPadScanningProcedure-small.gif" /></p>
<p>Then how is it possible to play a video game by pressing and holding a couple of keys all together? They need to be very responsive and accurate otherwise the gaming experience would be awful.</p>
<p>I was trying to understand how the keyboard driver works in the late 90s. So I thought if it has to be real-time, responsive and accurate we probably need a big flag number created out of ~110 bits (as much as the number of keys on a keyboard). This number can represent the whole keyboard state as each bit represents a key. 0 means the key is up and 1 means pressed.</p>
<p>I figured out whatever comes from the keyboard can be read from the I/O port number <code>0x60</code>. This is not a TCP port or something like that. This is so low level that there's a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3215878/what-are-in-out-instructions-in-x86-used-for">CPU instruction</a> for that called <code>IN</code> (<code>OUT</code> for writing data to an I/O port). Reading from an I/O port in Assembly is like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">IN</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">AL</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But it was only 8 bits. I checked the other numbers around (~75-85) but none of them were sending any data when I was pressing the keys. That was the moment I got introduced to the idea of <strong>even-driven design</strong>. </p>
<p>I realized that the keyboard sends two types of signals. One when a key is pressed and another one when it's released. I found my idea of 110 big flag number really stupid! It simply could be done as a stream of events and the OS or applications can create the real-time state of the whole keys at their side. Keeping one bit for indicating whether the key is up or down, it leaves us with 7 bits which means 127 keys using only one byte.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-48">a single-chip microcontroller</a> in the keyboard that scans the keys and sends the signals to the PC. Nowadays it still works exactly the same way except it sends the data through Bluetooth or a USB port which is standardized to work with not only keyboard but almost everything. </p>
<p>Modern PCs don't have any PS/2 connectors. Less modern ones remained compatible by emulating the USB Keyboards and Mice as PS/2 devices. This is called USB Legacy Support which you might have seen on your PC BIOS settings. Although even the legacy support itself has become obsolete.</p>
<p>You can try it on your *nix machine right now. Although not directly from IO ports, you can read the signals from your keyboard input device driver under <code>/dev/input/</code>. In my case it's like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /dev/input/by-id/usb-Metadot_-_Das_Keyboard_Das_Keyboard-event-kbd
</code></pre></div>

<p>You will see two separate events when a key is pressed or released.</p>
<p>Communicating through events and building the state remotely, instead of reflecting the whole state, is the idea behind the event-driven design. Whether it's a hack or an elegant design, the same approach is being used to replicate a database or share the state in a distributed system. The increased latency of transmitting the events increases the chance of getting conflicts in a distributed environment and resolving them is not as easy as the keyboard state, yet this is the safest and easiest solution available.</p>
