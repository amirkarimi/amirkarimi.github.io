                <p>In the fast-paced world of startups and business initiatives, finding the right technical expertise and leadership can be a daunting task. Whether you're starting from scratch with an MVP, scaling a successful product, or embarking on a new venture within an established company, the need for experienced engineering talent is crucial. However, the traditional routes of hiring full-time employees or relying solely on freelancers may not be enough. That's where a Fractional Head of Engineering steps in, offering a unique blend of expertise, strategic guidance, and flexible commitment.</p>

            </h2>

            <div class="summary">
                <p>Running Docker containers in production normally doesn't need <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/">mounting</a> local files or dirs. But when using Docker for development, it makes sense to mount the source code to avoid re-building the Docker image on every change. That looks straight forward except for some cases.</p>
<p>Some files or directories are generated by package managers or compilers during the compile time. They should be generated as part of the Docker image build and should stay untouched during runtime. On the other hand, mounting other files that need to be changed constantly during development is necessary.</p>
<p>This post uses an example app to experience different ways of using Docker volumes and learn about their pros and cons.</p>

            <div class="summary">
                <p>I needed to move a DigitalOcean Droplet to AWS which was running a Docker application using Docker Compose and had its SSL configured using Let's Encrypt. I couldn't find an easy way to convert the DigitalOcean disk snapshots to AWS EBS ones, otherwise, the whole disk could be cloned in AWS with much less effort since Linux configuration is all about the filesystem. I ended up installing needed packages on the target machine and move the configurations. Since I tested everything and it was successful I figured it might be useful to put all the commands and steps in the same place as a quick step-by-step guide. Also, the exact same steps apply to any other cloud as well as the other way around, from AWS to DigitalOcean.</p>

                <p>The event-driven design has already been around for a while. Like many other trendy patterns, it's far older than what we think. Before the web era, it was quite normal to design stand-alone desktop applications using this design. But it is even older than that. It has already been used massively since the mainframe era (and probably even before).</p>
<p>This is the story of how I learned about event-driven design without even knowing what it's called in the late 90s when I was just getting started to learn how computers work.</p>

            <div class="summary">
                <p>I use analogy whenever I need to explain something in the clearest and fastest possible way. Gaining knowledge in an abstract manner is hard and costly. Using existing knowledge as a foundation speeds up the learning process and prevents misunderstandings. When a C# developer, for instance, asks me what's <code>flatMap</code> in Scala, I'll ask if they know what's <code>SelectMany</code>? If they do, explaining how <code>flatMap</code> works on non-list types would be far faster and easier.</p>
<p>Now let's do this with Kubernetes and AWS. Let's see what are the Kubernetes components closest equivalents in AWS.</p>
<p>The point is that an analogy doesn't provide a deep understanding of a new concept, but it provides the foundation to speed up the learning process. So don't expect a conclusive 1:1 mapping from Kubernetes elements to AWS.</p>

<p>OK, you came to the conclusion that type-safety is good. It helps you get things
done in a safer manner, at least for whatever youâ€™re working on at the moment.
So you started using types more than before to describe what a piece of code
does without the need to run. In another word, to bring forward unwanted errors.</p>

It would be very nice if it was possible to use route parameters instead of cookies but as Play routes are (nicely, truly and correctly) type-safe, this will come at some cost; verbosity. Albeit it's not true for smart people who code in Scala :D</p>
