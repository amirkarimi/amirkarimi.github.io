title: "The Startup Stack: What I Recommend to Teams Building from Scratch in 2025"
---

When you’re building a product from scratch at an early-stage startup, your tech stack choices matter. A lot. You want speed, reliability, maintainability, and above all, focus. That means avoiding hype-driven development and sticking to tools that get out of your way.

As someone who's worked as a software engineer and fractional CTO for small startups, I’ve learned that simplicity scales better than you think. Below is the stack I recommend in 2025 to teams who want to ship fast and stay sane.

## Backend: Python + Django

Python remains the king of pragmatic programming languages. It's readable, batteries-included, and has a mature ecosystem. For most startups, Django is the best web framework to pair it with.

Why Django?

- **Rapid development**: You can go from idea to MVP in days, not weeks.
- **Out-of-the-box admin**: Django's admin console is gold. Non-technical team members can manage content and data with zero developer involvement.
- **Built-in security and best practices**: CSRF, XSS, SQL injection, Django handles the heavy lifting.
- **Scalable**: When your traffic grows, Django can handle it.

If you're building a CRUD-heavy web app (which most early-stage products are), Django is hard to beat.

## Frontend: Server-side rendering + HTMX

Many teams default to React or Vue without asking if they actually need a single-page application (SPA). Truth is, for most MVPs and even production apps, you don’t.

Start with Django’s server-side templates (Jinja or Django Template Language), sprinkle in a bit of CSS and vanilla JS, and layer on [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for interactivity.

HTMX gives you AJAX, CSS transitions, WebSockets, and more, all declaratively, without the SPA overhead. It integrates beautifully with Django and keeps your frontend logic close to the backend.

Benefits:

- **Faster to build and debug**
- **No frontend build step**
- **No need to manage a separate frontend repo**
- **Great UX without going full SPA**

Unless you’re building something like a design tool or complex dashboard, you likely don’t need a heavy frontend framework.

## Database: PostgreSQL

Use SQL. Use PostgreSQL.

It’s stable, mature, well-documented, and battle-tested. You get:

- ACID compliance
- Rich data types (JSON, arrays, full-text search)
- Window functions and CTEs
- Excellent tooling and ecosystem

Avoid NoSQL unless you have a very specific need (e.g. hierarchical documents or unstructured data). PostgreSQL has evolved so much that most “NoSQL use cases” can now be handled natively inside it.

And Django’s ORM works seamlessly with PostgreSQL.

## Dev Environment and Deployment: Docker Compose + Caddy

Your dev environment should mirror production. That’s where Docker Compose shines. It makes local dev setup repeatable and portable.

Compose lets you spin up your app, database, caching, and any other services in one go. No more “it works on my machine” issues.

For deployment, you can stick with Docker Compose on a small VM (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, EC2, etc.). It’s dead simple and gets the job done.

As your frontend web server, use **Caddy**:

- Automatic HTTPS via Let’s Encrypt
- Clean, readable config
- Lightweight and fast

You don’t need to mess with nginx or Certbot anymore. Caddy handles it all out of the box.

I’ll write a dedicated post about how to configure Caddy soon, but just know it takes a lot of pain out of deployment.

## CI/CD and Ops

Keep it simple. Use GitHub Actions or whatever’s built into your Git host. Don’t spend a week setting up fancy pipelines, just make sure you can build, test, and deploy reliably.

For monitoring and logs, start with basic tools:

- **Uptime monitoring**: UptimeRobot or BetterStack
- **Error tracking**: Sentry (Django has a plugin)
- **Logging**: Start with file logs, then move to something like Loki or Papertrail if needed

Don’t build a full DevOps stack unless your app demands it. Most don’t.

## Summary: The 2025 Startup Stack

| Layer        | Recommendation                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| Language     | Python                         |
| Web Framework| Django                         |
| Frontend     | Server-side templates + HTMX   |
| Database     | PostgreSQL                     |
| Deployment   | Docker Compose + Caddy         |
| Hosting      | Small VM (e.g. Hetzner, DO)     |
| CI/CD        | GitHub Actions                 |
| Monitoring   | UptimeRobot, Sentry, file logs |

## Final Thoughts

Startups are not FAANG. You don’t need bleeding-edge tools to ship quality products. In fact, overengineering is a silent killer in early-stage teams. You burn time, introduce bugs, and make hiring harder.

What you need is clarity and speed. This stack gives you both. It’s battle-tested, team-friendly, and simple enough to be maintained by a single engineer.

Ship early. Stay lean. Iterate fast.

And remember: boring tech is beautiful when it works.
