Open sourcing a small utility that made my life easier.

As consultants, we usually work with multiple clients. Separating the work isn't difficult until you start using the browser. For example, they might have different Google/Outlook accounts. Add to that your personal account, and it quickly becomes a mess to handle in the same browser. 

Another thing is the browser extensions. Imagine you and all your clients are using Toggl extension to track the time, and you should use a different account for each.

You would be able to use multiple profiles in Chrome and Firefox. But there's another problem. Let's say you click on a link from outside the browser (e.g., VSCode). In which profile should it be opened?

I implemented a solution that has been working very well for me. You can now check it out here: <https://github.com/amirkarimi/browser-hub>
